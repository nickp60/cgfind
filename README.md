# cgfind
Minimal way to find and download complete prokaryotic genomes

Getting genomes from NCBI can be annoying; here I made a simple static site to make it easy to go from organism name to genome sequence.



## Usage
To update the database, clone the repo, run `./commit.sh` .  The script doesn't actually make the commit, but it prints the commit message to the log so you can use that actually after adding the files.
